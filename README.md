# Rust Marching Cubes Generator

A performant, template implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm written in Rust, designed for exporting 3D geometry from [Signed Distance Field (SDF)](https://github.com/EmberNoGlow/SDF-Model-Editor-Demo). models.

## 🌟 Overview

This project provides a fast and memory-efficient implementation of the classic **Marching Cubes algorithm** for generating triangle meshes from a 3D scalar field (like an SDF).

It was initially developed to facilitate exporting geometry generated by my [SDF Model Editor](https://github.com/EmberNoGlow/SDF-Model-Editor-Demo).

**Algorithm Reference:** [Polygonizing a Scalar Field (Paul Bourke)](https://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/)

## 🚀 Getting Started & Usage

This template is designed to be easily integrated or run directly to generate an OBJ mesh from a defined implicit surface.

### Generating a Mesh

Run the executable in release mode for optimal performance:

```bash
cargo run --release -- -- --resolution 25 --output my_mesh.obj
--threshold 0.1
```

| Argument | Description | Recommended Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--resolution <N>` | The resolution (N x N x N grid) used to sample the implicit field. Higher values yield more detail but increase processing time. | `25` (or higher) |
| `--output <FILE>` | The name of the resulting geometry file (must be an `.obj`). | `my_mesh.obj` |
| `--threshold <T>` | The iso-value (isovalue) used by the algorithm to determine where the surface lies. | `0.1` (Avoid very high values, as they can cause mesh holes.) |
